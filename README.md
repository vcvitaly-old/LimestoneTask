**Test task (30m - 1h)**  
Task to check algorithmic skills and data structure
understanding.  
Given a number (Integer) where each digit is in range
1..7 according to the day of week (1 - Monday, 2 -
Tuesday... 7 -Sunday).  
E.g. 126 - means Monday, Tuesday and Saturday.  
Convert this number to the string, separating each digit
with ‘,’ for non consecutive sequence days, or ‘-’ for
consecutive sequence days.  

Examples:  
123 -> ‘1-3’  
135 -> ‘1,3,5’  
125 -> ‘1-2,5’  
12367 -> ‘1-3,6-7’  
134567 -> ‘1,3-7’  
At least one digit <1 or >7 -> error
